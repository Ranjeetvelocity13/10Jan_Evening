Selenium 

1. Types of testing
2. Disadvantage of manual testing 
3. Advantage  of automation testing 
=====================================================================================================

What is Software testing & why do we need s/w Testing?

s/w testing is basically an activity to identify and reporting defect on the software.
we are do s/w testing becaue of to deliver quality product to the customer and we will test the 
application according to the customer requirement weather it need the customer rquiremnt or not 
and is it  working according to the customer requirement or customer expections or not so that's
The reason we need to do the testing and before delevering the s/w to the customer we 
need to make sure our s/w is quality productso that's the main intetation of the s/w testing.

=========================================================================================================

Two tpes of testing 
1. Manula Testing
2. Automation Testing

Maunal Testing  - Manual testing is s/w testing procress in which test cases are executed manually without any 
automation tool.In the manual testing we have perform so many types of testing like  function nonfunction smoke 
datbase testing ,load testing,performance testing.

What is test cases - A test case is a set of actions performed on a system to determine if it satisfies software r
equirements and functions correctly. The purpose of a test case is to determine if different features within 
a system are performing as expected and to confirm that the system satisfies all related standards,
guidelines and customer requirements.


=================================================================================Functional testing - Behaviour of application (BIEBSC)
 

Retesting and Regression is a more important things because of these two retesting and regression automation
came into the picture

So when u do manual testing so these are the two areas where we need to put lot of time and efforts.

resting - Retesting is nothing but executing the same test case again and again with multiple set of data.

Regression testing - Testing the fixes whatever fixes they have done and we need to main focous on those fixesor weatherthese change working or not
and along with this we need to also make sure that other functionality should not affect that's the basically called as a regression testing. 

RT defination -  Regression testing is use to ensure that the recent changes does not affected the functionality.
Re-validating defect in newer builds and because of those fixes make sure there is no side effect.
Regression testing is required when threre is 
1. Changes in code
2. New feature is added
3. After Defect fixing

And in Rrgression testing we check first failed test cases and along with tthat we all the existing test cases.


Disadvantage of manual testing :

1.Manual Testing is time -  consuming mainly while doing regression testing.
2.Manual Testing requires more time or more resources, sometimes both Time and Resources.
3. Less Accuracy -(Human Users (Testers) may make mistakes, so we cannot expect more accuracy in Manual Testing,
   If it is Test Automation / Automated Testing, if you provide the correct logic then test tool can provide correct output.)
4.Processing change requests during software maintenance takes more time.

=====================================================================================================================
Automation Testing - Automation testing is the process of testing the software using an automation tools to find the 
defects.In this process, executing the test scripts and generating the results are performed automatically by 
automation tools.


Advantage  of automation testing :

1.Less human resources
2.Automation testing requires fewer people to perform a tedious manual test. To implement the automation test script, 
we need a test automation engineer who can write the test scripts to automate our tests.
3.Fast development and delivery
Automated tests can be executed repeatedly and completed rapidly. We do not have to wait for weeks to execute the tests; few hours are 
enough for execution. Switching from manual to automation reduces the waiting time and boosts developme
4.Ability to test on various platforms
5.Saves time
Automating the testing process helps the testing team to use less time to validate newly created features. For instance, in manual testing, there is a 
need to write thousand test cases for a calculator application, but automation makes the process much faster.
6. Cost of the will be reduced
7. Project duration will be reduced.

================================================================================================================

Different Automation tools:

1. Loadrunner
2. TesComplete
3. WunRunner
4. Selenium
5. IBM Rational functional Testers
6. HP QTP( QUick Test professional)

================================================================================================================

What is Selenium?
Selenium is functional and regression automation tool.
Selenium is webbased automationtool/collection of API's (Components).


1. Selenium IDE
2. Selenium RC 
3. Selenium Grid
4. Selenium webdriver

Selenium IDE - Plug-in only for firefox browser. Record and play back tool.
Selenium RC  -  Rc Server will interact with browser and execute automating test cases.
Selenium Grid - We can execute test cases remotely.
Selenium Webdriver - Webdriver is an interface which is present in API forms.

===========================================================================================================
Advantages of Selenium 

1. Open Source (Free)
2. Support Multiple language ( Java , Python, C#, Ruby)
3. Support Multiple Browsers ( Chrome, IE, Safari, MS Edge)
4. Support Multiple Operating system ( Window , Linux, MacOS)
5. Support PArallel Testing.
6. Selenium can integrate third party tool - ( TestNG, Maven, Jenkins, AzureDevops, git,github,Cucumber)

===========================================================================================================

Disadvantage Of Slenium(Limitations)

1. It can not handle window based applications. ( Not Support desktop/window based application) - AutoIT tool, Sikuli.
2. There is not dedicated support faculty. - N umbers of forms are available.
3. Can not automate captcha.     
4. Can not generate good report.   - TestNg, Extent report concept
5. Can not support working with excel excel sheet. - Apache Poi
6. Image based testing is supported.  (Certain level of testing we can do( Co-ordinate)
 
==========================================================================================================

Manual Testing pre-request

1. Requirement
2. Test scenarios
3. Test plan
4. TEst cases
5. Reporting defect.
===========================================================================================================

Automation Testing
1. Manual Test cases.
2. Application should be stable.

=============================================================================================================

Webdriver driver = new Chromdriver();

Explanation 

1. Search context is a super most interface which contains abstract methods
& inherited to web driver.
2. Web driver is an interface which contains abstract method of search
context and its own abstract methods.
3. All the abstract methods are overridden or implemented in selenium
remote web driver class.
4. Selenium remote web driver-it is class which implements all the abstract
methods of both interface (search context and web driver).
5. Selenium remote driver class is extended to browsers such as Firefox,
internet explorer, chrome…..etc.
6. To run application in multiple browsers (C.T) i.e writing test script by
using single browser but run the same script in multiple browser we need
to use runtime polymorphism by using up casting in selenium.
WebDriver driver = new Chrome Driver();
7. Create an object of ChromeDriver class with reference of WebDriver
interface.
=============================================================================================================

Selenium Architecture

1. After you trigger test cases(Script) the complete selenium code(client) which we have written will
   be converted to JSON format.
2. Generated JSON is sent to browser driver(Server) HTTP protocol.(Each browser contains a separate browser driver)
3. Browsers driver communicates with its respective browser and executes the command.
4. BD receives responses back from the real browser and its sends to JSON response back to the client.

===========================================================================================================
Web-driver Methods

1.Get()
This method is use to open an application or to enter url in a web
page or browser.
 Ex. WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
driver.get(“ url ”);
 get() method accept the string input only
 To perform action, return type void
=========================================================================================================
2.Close()
a) This method is use to close current tab of the browser
This method is use to close current tab of the browser
 Ex. driver.close();
 To perform action, return type void
==================================================================================================

3.Quit();
This method is the alternate method to the close method
 But the difference between the close and quite is that close() method
close the current tab only & quite() method will close all the tabs of
the browser.
 Ex. driver.quite();
================================================================================
4.getTitle()
String title=driver.getTitle();
Syso(title);
This method is use to get title of the web page as an output
 Return type of getTitle() is Stringsave and store an object
================================================================================
5.getCurrentUrl()
String url=driver.getCurrentUrl();
Syso(url);
This method is use to get url of the current web page as an output.
 Return type of getCurrentUrl() is Stringsave and store an object
================================================================================
6.maximize()
driver.manage().window().maximize();
 This method is used to maximize the browser
================================================================================

7.nevigate()
driver.nevigate().to(“enter url”)
driver,navigate().back();
driver.nevigate().forward();
driver,navigate().refresh();
This method is to open an application, move forward, backward
and refresh the browser.
 Navigate method can be used for alternate method for get method
 Can’t pass input directly to the navigate to call the to function
================================================================================

8.setSize()
Dimension d = new Dimension(width value, height value)
driver.manage().window().setSize(d);
this method is use to change size of the browser which accepts
dimensions arguments
 setSize() method can’t accept directly the width and height of the
browser. This method accept only dimension arguments.
 Before using setSize() method we need to create the object of the
dimension class and then pass the width and height of the browser in
the constructor of the dimension class
 Dimension class present in the selenium
 Type dime----use control+space
 To enter width and height value is the browser resolution or picsal
value

================================================================================
9.getSize()
Syso(driver.manage().window().getSize());
check the browser size immediate open of browser
 to check the size to call the printing statement and inside the printing
statement to call the function driver.manage().window().getSize()
 return dimension arguments in terms of width and height

================================================================================
10.setPosition()
Point p = new Point(int x, int y)
driver.manage().window().setPosition(p);

This method is use to change position of the browser which accept
point argument
 Before using setPosition() method we need to create the object of the
point class and then pass the x and y coordinate of the browser in the
constructor of the point class
 point class present in the selenium
 Type poi----use control+space

11.getPosition()
 check the position of the browser in terms of x and y coordinates
 to get this coordinate so to call the printing statement and inside the
printing statement to call the function
 driver.manage().window().getPosition()
 return point arguments in terms of x and y arguments

12.Thread.sleep(int miles)Java Class used for pause or wait purpose
================================================================================

Basic of HTML

HTML - HTML sStands for hyper text Markup Language 

1. Hypertext markup language used for creating a webpage
2. Html coding is not case sensitive
3. We can write html coding in notepad / notepad++
4. While saving html, extension of file should be “filename.html”
5. the meaning of use of / before name to close the sentence
6. toopenawebpage<html>openhtml&</html>closehtml
7. Give title or name of webpage between <title>open title & </title>close
title. This is dummy webpage
8. To mention some info to the webpage body so to enter the value between
<body>open body & </body>close body
9. </br>break to text break and give in the next line

CSS - Cascading style sheet 
JS  - Java Script

Summary
1. To create a webpage we need to use keyword “title”
2. Every keyword should be closed within angular brace using
forward slash(/)
3. To create a component or element we need to use a keyword
“input”
4. To create list we need to use “select” keyword
5. To create link we need to use keyword “a” with href keyword
6. To create a web table we need to use keyword “table”
7. To create image we need to use “img” keyword
1. Tagname
 Any keyword which is present immediately after angular brace(<)
less than symbol
 Eg. html, title, body, tr, table
2. Attribute
 Any keyword which is present immediately after tag-name with equal
to symbol until greater than symbol
 Syntax property name = property value
 Attribute name = attribute value
 Eg. type=’text’ , id=’1234’, class=’abc’, name=’xyz’
3. Text
 Any keyword which is present in between angular brace(>) greater
than symbol & angular brace (<) less than symbol is known as Text
 Eg. >sr no<, >link<, >manual<, >java<
Why html coding is required in selenium
 To identify an element uniquely and to perform action with the help of selenium html coding is necessary


================================================================================

Locaters  
I. Locators are used to identify an element with the help of locator types
II. To identify an element present in webpage we need to use ‘findElement’
method which is present in web driver.
Ex. WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver
Driver.findElement (By arg)
III. findElement method will identifies an element with the help of By class
which contains Static methods
IV. All the static methods present in By class are known as locator types

1.Tagname 
2.ID
3.Name
4.Class Name
5.LinkText
6.Partial link Text
7.Css Selector
8.Xpath


What is xpath?

it is a syntax or language for finding any element on the web page using xml pathe expression.
Xpath is used to find the location of any element on a webpage using HTML DOM Structure.
Xpath can be used to navigate through element and attribute in DOM.
Xpath is a address of element

1. Xpath by text
2. xpath by contains
3. xpath by index
4. xpath by attributes
5. absolute xpath
6. Relative xpath 

1. Xpath by text 
Syntax - //tagname[text()='text value']
Example - //driver.findElement(By.xpath("//button[text()='Log In']")).click();

2. Xpath by contains
Syntax - //tagname[contains(text(),'textvalue')]
Example :  driver.findElement(By.xpath("//button[contains(text(),'Log')]")).click();

3. xpath by index
Syntax : (Xpath Expression)[index number]
Example : //driver.findElement(By.xpath("(//li[@data-id=\"462\"])[2]"))

4. Xpath by attribute
Synatx: //tagname[@attributename="attribute value"]
 driver.findElement(By.xpath("//input[@id=\"dest\"]"));

=======================================================================================

2. Name

When we can use name as locator type
 If id & className is duplicate
 If id attribute & className is not present

 When we can’t use className
 name is not present
 name is duplicate

syntax - //By.name("namevalue");
driver.findElement(By.name("submit_search")).click();

==============================================================================

3. ID 
To create or select unique xpath for that reasons we use xapth by index.
syntax -
driver.findelemet(By.ID('Attributevalue');
RF       MEthod   Class     

==============================================================================
4.Tagname
tagName
DisadvantagesIf a webpage multiple elements are presented with same tagName and we
use tagName locator type to identify an element then selenium perform
action on first element present in webpage.
syntax :
driver.findElement(By.tagName("input"));
==============================================================================
5.className
 When we can use className as locator type
 If id is duplicate
 If id attribute is not present

 When we can’t use className
 className is not present
 className is duplicate

6. LinkText
 If tagName is duplicate id, className, name attribute are not present in
html code of an element then we should use linkText/partialLinkText.

7.partialLinkText

8. Css Selector
1.
#attributevalue
driver.findElement(By.cssSelector("#username")).sendKeys("Test@123");

2.
tagname#attributevalue
driver.findElement(By.cssSelector("input#password")).sendKeys("!@$$");

3.
class 
driver.findElement(By.cssSelector("input.form-control.private-form__control.login-email")).sendKeys("Rohit@gmail.com");

==========================================================================
Dynamic xpath
1. ID .
//driver.findElement(By.xpath("//button[contains(@id,'u_0_d_')]")).click();

2. startwith
// driver.findElement(By.xpath("//button[starts-with(@id,\"u_0_d_\")]")).click();

3. ends-with
//driver.findElement(By.xpath("//button[ends-with(@id,\"_TG\")]")).click()

==================================================================================
