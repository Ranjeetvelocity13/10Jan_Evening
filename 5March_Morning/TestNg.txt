TestNg - Testing framework  (Test Next generation)
//Most famous topic in selenium
//Purpose -  design test cases in systematic way.

1.Importance of TestNg     
2. Installation and configuration in eclipse
3. Test XML file importance
4. Controlling test cases executions from testng XML file.
5. Include exclude mechanism
6. Understanding of testNG annotations
7. Groups
8.Data Provider annotations
9. Annotations helper attribute
10. Paramertization in  TestNg xml file
11.Running tests in parallel with TestNg

Installation and configuration in eclipse
1. Go to your help page and select eclipse marketplace option.
2. Search TestNg in search box.
3. Select TestNg for eclipse option.
4. Click on install-button

Cross check 
Go to on window and search TestNG if u see this testng that means testng is successfully installed in your machine

How to run test with TestNg
Ans -You need to have @TestAnnotations followed by methods

You can define multiple test  from single class
You can modulizare the test case bases on functionality and trigger them accordingly 

======================================================

3. Test XML file importance

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>      
<!DOCTYPE suite SYSTEM "https://testng.org/testng-1.0.dtd">
<suite name="Loan department">     //
  <test name="Personal loan">
    <classes>
      <class name="Demo.day1"/>
      <class name="Demo.day2"/>
      <class name="Demo.day4"/>
    </classes>
  </test>
  <test name="Car loan"> 
  <classes>
 
      <class name="Demo.day3"/>

    </classes>
  </test>
</suite>

TestNG Notes

it is also called TDD - Test driven development
TestNG is Testing new generation framework.
Purpose - Design Test cases in systematic way.
Testng is open source & it's freely available
it's available in the form of jar files 
it is also called  Java unit testng framework

Advantaged
1. Design a test cases in a systematic way.
2. It will generate very good html report.
3. It gives lot of annotation.
4. Priority/sequences will gives
5. Dependency
6. Grouping 
7. Data-provider  -important feature

How to pass Parameters


=======================================================================================================
What is Assertion? 
1. Assertion helps us to verify the condition of the test and decide weather test has failed or passed.
A  test is considered successful only if it is completed without throwing any exception

Types of assertion
1. Hard assertion
2. Soft Assertion

Hard Assert: 
Hard Assert throws an AssertException immediately when an assert statement fails and test suite 
continues with next @Test

Hard Assertion means if any particular assertion is getting failed immediately after that all the corresponding lines in that 
particular test cases will not be executed. and that particulaetest cases immedialy terminated and this test cases will be 
marked as a failed.


1. Assert.assertTrue();
2. Assert.assertFalse();
3. Assert.assertEquals();

Soft Assert: Soft Assert collects errors during @Test Soft Assert does not throw an exception when an assert
 fails and would continue with the next step after the assert statement
 
1.SoftAssert softAssert = new SoftAssert();
softAssert.assertTrue(condition);

softAssert softAssert=newSoftAssert();
softAssert.AssertTrue(condition);

==========================================================================================================
diff b/w Soft asseertion and hard assertion

Q -What is the difference between soft assertion and hard assertion?
Soft Assertion: In case of Soft Assertion, if TestNG gets an error during @Test, it will throw an exception when an
 assertion fails and continues with the next statement after the assert statement.

Hard Assertion: In the case of Hard Assertion, if TestNG gets an error during @Test, it will throw an AssertException 
immediately when an assertion fails and stops execution after the assert statement.

@DataProvider Annotations

@DataProvider annotation helps us write data driven test cases. 
The @DataProvider annotation enables us to run a test method multiple times by passing different data sets.
